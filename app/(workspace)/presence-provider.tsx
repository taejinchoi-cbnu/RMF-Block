 * publishes `DocWatched` to the other clients on attach and `DocUnwatched` when
 * the watch stream ends, whether that was a clean detach, a closed tab, or Wi-Fi
 * dropping. Nothing here polls, and nothing here has to notice a disconnect.
 *
 * It is a provider rather than a component that renders the roster itself
 * because two things need the same list — the top bar's stack and the Members
 * screen — and two components each opening a `yorkie.Client` would mean two
 * connections per browser. Living in the workspace layout also keeps the
 * connection up across navigations inside the group: a per-page component would
 * detach and re-attach on every move, and everyone else would watch you leave
 * and rejoin.
 *
 * Identity arrives as three strings rather than one member object on purpose:
 * a fresh object every render would give the effect a new dependency every
 * render, and it would tear down and rebuild the Yorkie connection each time.
 *
 * The address comes from the page's own URL, never from the server. Whatever
 * host someone typed to reach the app is one they can reach; being handed a
 * different one is what broke this on the desktop, where a page at
 * `localhost:3000` was told to fetch the LAN address and every browser refused
 * to cross out of the loopback address space.
